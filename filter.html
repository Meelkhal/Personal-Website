										<h1>Thumbnail Filter</h1>
									</header>

									<hr class="major" />


									<p>In a previous <a href="scraper.html">project</a>, I created a webscraper that scrapres car listing data from used car websites. However
										since most car listing websites are fairly difficult to moderate users may often list a listing that could be considered "undesirable". So what do I mean by an 
									undesirable car listing? Usually for me a listing is undresirable if it has a thumbnail that doesn't accurately portray the vehicle that we wish to buy. </p>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="assets/images/Thumbnail Filter/badlisting.jpg" alt="" /></span>	

									<p>Looking at the above image, I would consider this one that would be undesirable as it doesn't actually show the vehicle in question. This is undesirable as most
										used car buyers want to have a look of the actual used car so they can make a detailed analysis. It always helps to have a thumbnail that accurately portrays the vehicle
										as it can help us filter out damaged or undesirable vehicles when searching for a used car. I dislike the above use of the thumbnail as it requires more work for me as the buyer as 
										I have to reach out to the dealer to figure out if the vehicle is good or bad.

									</p>

									<h3>Thumbnail Filter in Action</h3>

									<p>Using work from my other project we can import the scraper directly, one thing we do need to create is a script that will take the thumbnail links
									and save the images to a .jpg and .png file.
								
									</p>

									<h3>Creating the Thumbnail Filter</h3>

									<p>To create the thumbnail filter I will do so by using a neural network classifier to distinguish between thumbnail images
										that are satisfactory or unsatisfactory. I will try my hand at creating my own neural network classifier and compare it
										to some popular prebuilt models.
									</p>

									<h3>Building a CNN Classifier From Scratch</h3>
									
									<p>A simple way of understanding a CNN classifier is it's composed of two parts, a <b>convolutional base</b> and a 
									<b>dense head</b>.</p>
									<img src="assets/images/Thumbnail Filter/covnet.png" alt="" />
									
									<p>
									The above diagram can help us understand how a CNN classifier would work. First an image is sent into the convolutional base 
									that is broken down into multiple features that are relevant to our object in question. After the physical features are extracted
									a <b>dense head</b> would then classify the object based on the obtained features. 
									</p>

									<p>The below image can help us understand how a convulational base works with respect to classification of the model of a car. 
										the <b>convulational base</b> would be able to obtain the physical features such as the window, chassis, bumper and wheel
										of the car. The dense head would then obtain these segments of the vehicle and recognize that the following features likely
										correspond to a "VW BUG" and would thus select that as a viable choice.
									</p>
									<img src="assets/images/Thumbnail Filter/convbase.png" alt="" />

									<h4> Building the Convolutional Base</h4>
									
									As we stated above the purpose of the convolutional base is to extract features for us, feature extraction typically is done in the following way:
									<ul>
										<li>Filter: We wish to filter a particular feature of interest.</li>
										<li>Detect: We want to be able to detect the feature of interest.</li>
										<li>Condense: We want to condense unnesccarry information to optimally process a feature.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Filtering & Detection:</h4>

									<p> The weights that a Conv net learns during traning are typically contained within its convolutional layer. The weights
										are typically referred to as <b>kernels</b> and can be represented as an array of values:</p>

									<img src="assets/images/Thumbnail Filter/kernel.png" alt=""/>
									
									<p>This image would represent a 3x3 kernel with each pixel corresponding to a different weight value. The kernel would then be used
										to sweep through the image to obtain an <b>activation map</b> which helps us filter out the desired features in our image.
									</p>

									<img src="assets/images/Thumbnail Filter/Activation.png" alt="">

									<p>This image illustrates the process very well. The 3x3 kernel sweeps through a fraction of the 5x5 input image and assigns it a new value
										corresponding to the "purple" pixel on the output image. If the kernel is effective the output image's pixels will highlight the desired
										desired features we wish to see.
									</p>

									<h4>Filtering & Detection Example</h4>

									<p>Here's an image of a BMW, lets see what it would look like if we applied a filter to it.</p>

									<img src="assets/images/Thumbnail Filter/prefilterbmw.png" alt="">

									<p>One filter I want to try is known as "Edge-Dectect" a 3x3 example looks like this:</p>

									<img src="assets/images/Thumbnail Filter/edgedetect.png" alt="">

									<p>It can be implemented with the following code.</p>
									
									
									<pre><code class="language-python">import tensorflow as tf
kernel = tf.constant([
	[-1, -1, -1],
	[-1,  8, -1],
	[-1, -1, -1],
])

plt.figure(figsize=(3, 3))
show_kernel(kernel)</code></pre>
								
<p>Applying it to our image it follows its name and we can see that it filters out the image of the BMW.</p>
									<img src="assets/images/Thumbnail Filter/postfilterbmw.png" alt="">

									<h4> Condensing and Pooling</h4>

									<p>In the previous step we applied some filtering and detection, the next step is to apply what is known as 
										<b>condensing</b> and <b>pooling</b>. This step is important from a computational perspective as often times
										when a feature is filtered we often carry some "dead space" which is useless and redundant data. Let's look at
										an example:
									</p> 

									<img src="assets/images/Thumbnail Filter/condensingpool.png" alt="">

									<p>In this image we essentially pool up the values in a 2x2 block and map it into a smaller image. Although we lose
										some information computationally it helps as we lose a lot of the black space.
									</p>

									<h3> Building the ConvNet to Filter Out "Tarp Style" Images</h3>

									<p>Now that we have covered the background needed to create a convNet, let's build one. I will consider a fairly simple case in which I wish to filter out
										images that have tarps within them like the following:</p>

										<img src="assets/images/Thumbnail Filter/tarp.jpg" alt="">

									<p>The code for creating the convNet is fairly simple.</p>

									<pre><code class="language-python">from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Flatten, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image

model = Sequential()
# The First Convolutional Block
model.add(Conv2D(128, (5,5), 1, activation='relu', input_shape=(256, 256, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D())
# The Second Convolutional Block
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3,3), 1, activation='relu', input_shape=(256, 256, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D())
# The Third Convulational Block
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3,3), 1, activation='relu', input_shape=(256, 256, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D())
# Classifier Head
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss=tf.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(), metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()</code></pre>

								<p>Finally lets fit the model to the data and analyze the model accuracy and the loss.</p>
